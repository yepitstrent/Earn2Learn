<p align="center"><b>Random Question</b></p>

<p>Random Questions may be added to any category.</p>

<p>When you add a Random Question to a quiz, then it will be replaced
   with a randomly-chosen question from the same category - for each attempt.</p>

<p>This means that different students are likely to get a different selection 
   of questions when they attempt this quiz.  When a quiz allows multiple 
   attempts for each student then each attempt will also contain a new 
   selection of questions.</p>
   
<p>The same question will never appear twice in a quiz.  If you include several 
   Random Questions then different questions will always be chosen for each of them. 
   If you mix Random Questions with non-random questions then the random questions 
   will be chosen so that they do not duplicate one of the non-random questions.</p>

<p>The grade for the randomly chosen question will be rescaled so that the 
   maximum grade is what you have chosen as the grade for the Random Question.</p>
