<p align="center"><b>Random Short-Answer Matching questions</b></p>

<p>After an optional introduction, the respondent is presented with
   several sub-questions and several jumbled answers.  There is one
   correct answer for each question.</p>

<p>The respondent must select an answer to match each sub-question.</p>

<p>Each sub-question is equally weighted to contribute towards the
   grade for the total question.</p>

<p>The questions and answers are randomly drawn from the pool of
   "Short Answer" questions in the current category.  Each attempt
   on a quiz will have different questions and answers.</p>
