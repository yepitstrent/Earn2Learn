<p align="center"><b>Resubmitting assignments</b></p>

<p>By default, students cannot resubmit assignments once the teacher has graded them</p>

<p>If you turn this option on, then students will be allowed to resubmit assignments
   after they have been graded (for you to re-grade).  This may be useful if the 
   teacher wants to encourage students to do better work in an iterative process.</p>

<p>Obviously, this option is not relevant for offline assignments.</p>
