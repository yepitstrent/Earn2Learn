<h1>Future</h1>
<blockquote>
  <p>As Moodle gains in maturity, its directions are increasingly influenced by 
  the community of developers and users. A dynamic database of proposed features 
  and their status can be found at <a target="_top" href="http://moodle.org/bugs/">moodle.org/bugs</a>. 
  Your <a href="?file=credits.html">contributions</a> in the form of ideas, code, 
  feedback and promotion are all very welcome - see the <a href="?file=developer.html">Developers 
  manual</a> and the <a href="http://moodle.org/help" target="_top">community forums</a> for more details. You can also pay to have certain features developed sooner- see <a href="http://moodle.com/development/" target="_top">moodle.com/development</a> for information and a quote. </p>
  <p>Here is the current roadmap of the future, though this is always subject to change depending on <a href="http://moodle.org/donations/" target="_blank">sponsors</a> and <a href="/?file=credits.html">developers</a>. </p>
  <h3>Version 1.5 - February 2005</h3>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Moodle 1.5 aims to make Moodle fully compliant with important web accessibility standards such as WAI (W3C), SENDA (UK) and Section 508 (US).</p>
    <p>The display code will conform to XHTML Transitional 1.0, and the CSS has also been cleaned up and extended to give designers more complete control over the look and feel of their sites. This release will not yet use templates. </p>
    <p>There is also a long list of new features such as: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Integrated instant Messaging feature for direct communication</li>
      <li>Big improvements to the Quiz module, including: paged quizzes with a certain number of questions per page; improved interface for building quizzes; heirarchical question categories; </li>
      <li>New block format, allowing multiple copies of blocks and better block configuration (old third-party blocks need to be upgraded, see the docs in the blocks directory) </li>
      <li>Extended LDAP integration, so that LDAP can now control course creation, group assignments, user synchronisation etc</li>
      <li>Certain user fields can be locked by the admin </li>
      <li>Improved uploading, with support for automated Virus scanning of new documents using ClamAV.</li>
      <li> Streamlined interface for the Workshop and Lesson modules </li>
      <li> New Tidy filter to convert all user-supplied texts into XHTML</li>
      <li> PAM authentication module</li>
      <li> Sessions can now be stored in the database (useful for Moodle clusters)</li>
      <li>Site Policy Agreements for users </li>
      <li>Many  other improvements and bug fixes </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
