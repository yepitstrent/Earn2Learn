KHMER language pack for Moodle

Translated by vichika vichika@everyday.com.kh

ATTENTION: This is an UTF-8 language pack, but you have to install the Khmer font.
This is provided in the fonts folder of the language pack. The font is public domain. 
More information about Khmer and the Khmer font on http://khmeros.info/drupal/
