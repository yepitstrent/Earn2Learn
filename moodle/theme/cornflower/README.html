<h3>CR-CornflowerToo THEME</h3>
<hr />

<p>CR-CornflowerToo is based on the color scheme of the original Cornflower Theme.</p>

<p>Free Moodle themes can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.classroomrevolution.com">ClassroomRevolution</a> under Themes.</p>

<p>All CR-Themes will be updated to 1.5 in due time.</p>

<p>Support <a href="http://www.moodle.org">Moodle</a> and Open Source Software</p>


<p>This theme is based on Moodle's Standard Theme.  By default, the styles of the Standard theme
are automatically loaded before any other
themes, so that all custom themes need to do is to define their
own styles to augment or overwrite particular standard styles.</p>

<p>For CR-CornflowerToo to work properly, the Moodle Standard theme must be present and un altered in the Theme directory.</p>

<p>In this way custom themes are not "left behind" by Moodle upgrades.</p>
