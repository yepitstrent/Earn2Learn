<h1>Time limit</h1>

<p>A quiz can have a time limit. This is stored in minutes in
$quiz->timelimit. So before using this in time calculations it
always has to be multiplied by 60 to turn it into seconds like all
other timestamps in moodle and php. If $quiz->timelimit is zero it
means there is no timelimit.</p>

<p>If a student asks to start an attempt on view.php for a quiz with
a timelimit then he is shown a javascript message alerting him to
the timelimit and is asked to confirm.</p>

<p>For quizzes with timelimit attempt.php shows a javascript timer
that counts down and automatically submits and closes the attempt
when the time is up.</p>

<p>Confusingly there are two javascript timers in the quiz module.
jsclock.php provides a countdown in the title bar that counts down
to the quiz closing time if this is less than a day away. This has
nothing to do with the timelimit. jstimer.php provides the countdown
timer that implements the timelimit. It in turn uses timer.js.</p>

<p>The time a response was submitted by the student is recorded by
attempt.php right at the top of the page and is then passed on to
quiz_process_responses in $action->timestamp. This puts it into
$state->timestamp. Finally, after the responses have been graded,
the function quiz_apply_penalty_and_timelimit() checks that the
responses are within the timelimit to within 5% and if not it sets
the grade to zero (or the previously obtained grade, if that is
higher).</p>
