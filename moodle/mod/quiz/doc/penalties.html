<h1>Penalty mechanism</h1>

<h2>What it is for</h2>

<p>When the quiz is run in adaptive mode the student can interact
with a question repeatedly. So in particular the student can try
again when he gets a wrong answer. Clearly the final mark for the
question must reflect the fact that the student did not get it right
originally. Therefore a penalty is subtracted from the final
mark.</p>

<h2>How the penalty is determined</h2>

<p>First of all penalties are relevant only if a quiz is run in
adaptive mode. Only in this case can a student have a second attempt
and therefore only in this mode can there be any occasion to
subtract a penalty.</p>

<p>Even in adaptive mode the penalty mechanism is only used when it
is selected in the quiz options. If "Apply penalties" is set to "No"
then the final mark for the question is the mark for the last graded
response.</p>

<p>Each question has a 'penalty' field (which should really be
called 'penaltyfactor') which is a number between 0 and 1. The
penalty for a wrong response is calculated as the product
($quiz->penalty * $quiz->grade), i.e., as the product of the
penaltyfactor with the maximum achievable grade for the question.
This product is stored in $state->penalty. So $quiz->penalty is the
fraction of the maximum grade that is subtracted as a penalty for
each wrong response.</p>

<p>The $quiz->penalty field has a default value of 0.1, both in the
database and in mod/quiz/defaults.php. This default can of course be
overwritten by the admin on the quiz configuration page. This
admin-selected default is (as usual for admin defaults) stored in
$CFG->quiz_penalty. The teacher can choose a different penalty
factor for each individual question when adding or editing a
question.</p>

<p>Now if a student makes repeated wrong attempts (or partially
correct attempts) the penalties for all these attempts are added up
in $state->sumpenalties. The mark for the question is then
calculated as the mark for the last graded response minus the sum of
the penalties.</p>

<p>One curious fact about $state->sumpenalties is that, for
efficiency reasons, it is not stored in the quiz_states table but
instead in the 'sumpenalty' field of the quiz_newest_states table.
That way it only has to be stored once per attempt rather than once
per response.</p>

<h2>Where it is done in the code</h2>

The function quiz_apply_penalty_and_timelimit() subtracts the penalty in
$state->sumpenalty from the raw grade in $state->raw_grade to obtain
$state->grade for the response. However it is ensured that the grade
of a new attempt at the question never falls below the previously
achieved grade. This function also increases $state->sumpenalty by
the amount in $state->penalty. The assumption is that
$state->penalty has just been set appropriately by the code calling
this function, e.g., quiz_process_responses.
