<h1>Paging</h1>

<p>Quiz attempts can be paged, i.e., spread over several pages. The
student can naviagate between the pages using the standard Moodle
paging bar. When the student navigates to a different quiz page the
answers on the current page are automatically submitted for saving
(bot not grading).</p>

<p>To do this automatic submission the paging bar needs some
javascript. It is therefore not produced with Moodle's standard
print_paging_bar() function from weblib.php but with
quiz_print_navigation_panel() which is defined in
mod/quiz/locallib.php and produces something that looks the
same.</p>

<p>The teacher has complete control via the edit interface on
edit.php over where the page breaks should occur. He can repaginate
the quiz with any chosen number of questions per page. He can also
move the page-breaks up and down using the arrows.</p>

<p>Internally page breaks are stored in the $quiz->questions field
(which now should really be called $quiz->layout). This field
contains a comma separated list of questionids and pagebreaks where
the pagebreaks are represented by the id 0. For example 23,12,0,11,
0 means that the two questions with ids 23 and 12 are on the first
page and the question with id 11 is on the second page. The last
page break is invisible and Moodle sometimes puts it there itself
for its own convenience.</p>

<p>Because the quiz has an option $quiz->shufflequestions to shuffle
questions the layout that the student sees in a particular attempt
does not necessarily have to be the same as that stored in
$quiz->questions. Therefore each attempt has its own $attemp->layout
field. If $quiz->shufflequestions is false then this just contains a
copy of $quiz->questions but if it is true then during the creation
of a new attempt by quiz_create_attempt() the function
quiz_repaginate() is used to produce a layout with
$quiz->questionsperpage number of questions per page that are
randomly ordered.</p>

<p>Both attempt.php and review.php use the $attempt->layout field to
determine what questions to show on a particular page. That way we
can guarantee that the student will, for a particular attempt,
always see the questions in the same order and with the same
pagination, both while attempting and during review. Also a teacher
when reviewing a student's attempt sees the pages the same way they
were shown to the student. However the teacher is also given the
option to see all questions on one page.</p>

<p>There are some functions in locallib.php dedicated to handling
the layout fields: quiz_questions_on_page(),
quiz_questions_in_quiz(), quiz_number_of_pages(),
quiz_first_questionnumber(), quiz_repaginate(). They are very short
functions. The function quiz_first_questionnumber() that determines
the number of the first question on a particular page makes use of
the $question->length field. To allow this calculation to be fast is
the main reason why that field is in the question table even though
it could also be determined easily from the question type.</p>
